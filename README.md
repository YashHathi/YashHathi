## Hi there 👋
My name is Yash Hathi and I am a first year student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign pursuing a degree in Statistics and minoring in Data Science with the goal of adding a second major in economics in the foreseeable future. In addition I am a course assistant at UIUC for STAT/CS/IS 107 (Data Science Discovery), one the largest introductory data science courses in the country. I am interested in Data Analytics and Data Science and its applications in a variety of industries such as sports, finance, technology, healthcare, and education.
